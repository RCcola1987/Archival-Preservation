# How to contribute
If you know of any resource type that I archive that is in need of archiving please open an issue and I will make a best effort to archive it.

## Perfered Resources
The items I perfer to archive are Youtube channels in thret of being deleted. Especially educational, gaming, political, and science content. For example anything Nintendo since they copyright strike everything and can burn in hell.
